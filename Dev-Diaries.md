# Day-3
-I finally was able to deploy the site and setup github actions


-The error was that the default nextjs.yml file was outdated as it used "next export" which is deprecated in favor of output : export property in next.config.js so I had to serach forums and documentations for that and fix the code myself. Then finally it deployed at ayushispro2011.github.io/retrodown



//note for myself
-Make image optmizatiion true in the server side version
